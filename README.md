# HostelCypher-2.0
I have updated the HostelCypher (Hostel Allocation System) project into next level, and now the site is more efficient and more user friendly than previous one.

Few things are here which are need be implemented while accessing my project,

1) You have to create a folder name "database" inside the project folder.
   
2) Then u need to create the below mentioned files,

    a) allocations.txt

    b) error.log

    c) maintenance.txt

    d) rooms.txt

    e) student_profiles.txt

    f) users.txt

    g) waiting_list.txt
   
4) After creating these files you need to add this belox mentioned data in rooms.txt

   "# Rooms database - Format: room_no|room_type

    101|single

    102|single

    103|double

    104|double

    105|single

    201|single

    202|double

    203|double

    204|single

    205|double"
 
6) Now you are set to go and run the site, host the site in inbuilt server or in localhost and boom you are in.

7) One more thing which is important, here users can login from login form and they will reach to their user panel, but to access the admin panel special credentials need to be used, for admin username: "admin" and password: "admin123", only by using this credential an admin can login.

8) Now you are all set to go, Enjoy the project.
